    "A: Cher's top 3 and bottom 3 songs based on sentiment are printed above. For the positive sentiment songs (My Love, You Wouldn't Know Love, and My Love 318663), the lyrics include the word love repeatedly which probably drives the positive sentiment. For the negative sentiment songs (Skin Deep, Chiquititas Spanish version, and Cry Myself to Sleep), the lyrics include words such as fire, trouble, cry, dangerous, distress, and dark which drives the negative score. I think Chiquititas is mistakenly included in this list because it is in Spanish, so the sentiment is not accurately calculated."

    "\n",
    "A: Robyn's top 3 and bottom 3 songs based on sentiment are printed above. For the positive sentiment songs (Jag Vet En Dejlig Rosa, Baby Forgive Me, and Monument), the lyrics include the words power, love, forgive, monument, and smile which probably drives the positive sentiment. I think Jag Vet En Dejlig Rosa is mistakenly included in this list because it is in Spanish, so the sentiment is not accurately calculated. For the negative sentiment songs (Don't Fucking Tell Me What To Do, Criminal Intent, and Crash and Burn Girl), the lyrics include words such as killing, criminal, hurt, crash, and burn which drives the negative score."
